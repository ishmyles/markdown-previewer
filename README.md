# Markdown Previewer

This web application is a solution to freeCodeCamp's [Markdown Previewer Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) - you can try it out [here](https://ishmyles.github.io/markdown-previewer/).

The project was created with:

- [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) - a markdown compiler used for parsing markdown.
- [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) - sanitizer used for HTML sanitizing & prevention of XSS attacks.
